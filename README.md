A simple, terminal-based birthday reminder app for those who hate using Facebook.


I wrote this to learn C better than I felt I would from my classes and had it working to various extents at different stages of its development. 
Most of the problems came from segfaults, and at the time I didn't know Rust (or much about it) so it's high on my to-do list to
re-write this in Rust, where I can sleep well at night knowing I won't get any unsafe behavior.
